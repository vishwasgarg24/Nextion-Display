# Nextion-Display
Nextion is a Human Machine Interface (HMI) solution. Nextion displays are resistive touchscreens that makes it easy to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is a great solution to monitor and control processes, being mainly applied to IoT applications.

There are several Nextion display modules, with sizes ranging from 2.4” to 7”.

The Nextion has a built-in ARM microcontroller that controls the display, for example it takes care of generating the buttons, creating text, store images or change the background. The Nextion communicates with any microcontroller using serial communication at a 9600 baud rate.

So, it works with any board that has serial capabilities like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, ESP32, and so on.
